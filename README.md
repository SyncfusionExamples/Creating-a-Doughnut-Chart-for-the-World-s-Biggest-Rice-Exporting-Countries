 # Creating a Doughnut Chart for the World's Biggest Rice Exporting Countries
 
The doughnut chart is used to show the relationship between parts of the data and the whole data.

## Customization :
We can customize the color, border, and width of the doughnut segment using the [Palette](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Palette), [Stroke](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeries_Stroke), and [StrokeThickness](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeries_StrokeThickness) properties respectively. Data points below a certain value are grouped using the [GroupTo](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.CircularSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_CircularSeriesBase_GroupTo) property. The [StartAngle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.CircularSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_CircularSeriesBase_StartAngle) and [EndAngle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.CircularSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_CircularSeriesBase_EndAngle) properties are used to alter the beginning and end positions of a chart segment.

## Center View :
The [CenterView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.DoughnutSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_DoughnutSeries_CenterView) property of the DoughnutSeries allows you to add any view to the center of the doughnut chart. It helps to understand the information about the provided data.

In 2022, rice exports were 55.64 million tons, which is 0.48 million tons less than the previous year. Rice export figures have a significant impact on global trade dynamics as rice is the staple food of the world.

This article explains how to create a doughnut chart to visualize the largest rice exporting countries in the world.
